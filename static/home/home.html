                        Company owners are always trying to invest on profitable markets and increase their customer base. In order to do that,
                        it is required to analyze the customers’ behavior in terms of their purchase patterns such as purchase quantity,
                        frequency, and consistency. The changes of those parameters are highly related with what customers have commented
                        about those given products on e-commerce websites such as tmall, Amazon, Taobao etc. But, this is quite difficult
                        when it comes to analyzing a large market such as China, United States, United Kingdom and etc. In our system, we have
                        implemented a Generic Online Digital Platform which provides a real-time dashboard to view analytics regarding customer
                        journey of a business. This system has provided an interactive dashboard which allows businessmen, producers, investors
                        and potential to analyze the market on a given product specially focusing on China Market. The system has three main
                        modules Customer Trust Index, Feature Analysis of and customer reviews and Customer Pain Point Analysis.

                        Customer Trust Index is an indicator of the level of customer loyalty. In this module, customers are clustered into
                        groups according to the values ‘recency’, ‘frequency’ and ‘monetary value’ of their purchases using a clustering
                        algorithm( k-means clustering). In the Feature Analysis module, the reviews on e-commerce websites posted by those
                        customers are analyzed and a finer-grained opinion mining is carried on based on NLP techniques and dependency grammar.
                        <feature, opinon> pairs are extracted for the reviews of a given product and this is useful in identifying what are
                        the reviewed features of the products and also the given opinions. In Pain Point Analysis module, the customer trust
                        index ,review sentiment analysis and review analysis are combined to rank the Product pain points.In this section higher
                        loyalty level customer posted higher negative polarity review are ranked the highest pain point.
